# SwampUp 2025 ‚Äî AI Security Demo & Slides

Welcome to the SwampUp 2025 presentation materials for:  
## **When AI Agents Go Rogue: Securing the New Attack Surface**

## About the Talk

**The problem:** 84% of developers now use AI agents, but only 29% trust their accuracy. We're adopting tools faster than we can secure them.

**The reality:** AI agents aren't just writing code anymore. Through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), they're managing your repositories, deploying to production, and accessing sensitive infrastructure with your credentials. Hundreds of MCP servers launched on GitHub this year alone‚Äîeach one a potential attack vector that traditional security tools can't see.

**What's different:** These aren't your typical vulnerabilities. AI agents can be compromised through their reasoning process itself:
- **Prompt injection attacks** disguised as GitHub issues that trick agents into leaking secrets
- **Tool poisoning** where legitimate MCP servers get hijacked to execute malicious commands  
- **Intent breaking** that turns your helpful code reviewer into a data exfiltrator
- **Token passthrough attacks** where one compromised agent becomes a trojan horse for your entire system

**The solution:** This talk demonstrates how GitHub became the first platform to integrate secret scanning directly into MCP tool calls, stopping prompt injection attacks before secrets leave your control. You'll see real attacks blocked in real-time, learn how to audit your existing MCP installations, and discover how end-to-end provenance from GitHub Actions to JFrog Evidence creates cryptographic proof that your AI agents aren't going rogue.

**What you'll leave with:** Specific commands to audit your MCP setup tonight, a framework for securing AI agents without killing productivity, and actionable strategies that work whether you're defending against sophisticated attacks or just trying to prove to compliance that your binaries came from trusted source code.

This isn't about fearing AI‚Äîit's about making AI agents both powerful and provable in your environment.

## üõ°Ô∏è Demo Instructions

To run the live demo of MCP Scan:

```bash
# Build the scanner
go build -o mcp-scan ../

# Run a demo scan on intentionally vulnerable configs
./mcp-scan demo

# Scan the provided configs in this folder
./mcp-scan -c vulnerable-config.json -c secure-config.json
```

- The `demos/` folder contains realistic configurations for both best-practices and intentionally unsafe setups.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Demo Configurations

- **secure-config.json:** Strong security practices
- **vulnerable-config.json:** Multiple security flaws
- **mixed-config.json:** Secure and risky patterns
- **development-config.json:** Common pitfalls in dev environments
