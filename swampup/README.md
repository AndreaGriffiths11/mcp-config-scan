# SwampUp 2025 ‚Äî AI Security Demo & Slides

Welcome to the SwampUp 2025 presentation materials for:  
## **When AI Agents Go Rogue: Securing the New Attack Surface**

---

## About the Talk

AI agents are evolving from helpful assistants to autonomous teammates with real system access. But what happens when they go rogue?  
As AI agents leverage the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to access repositories, infrastructure, and sensitive data, new attack vectors emerge‚Äîones that traditional security tools can't handle:

- **AI worms:** Self-replicating through prompt engineering  
- **Malicious MCP servers:** Manipulating agent behavior  
- **Automated credential theft:** At massive scale  

GitHub is the first platform to integrate secret scanning directly into AI/MCP tool calls, using AI to catch secrets even in non-traditional file formats and agent workflows.

## üõ°Ô∏è Demo Instructions

To run the live demo of MCP Scan:

```bash
# Build the scanner
go build -o mcp-scan ../

# Run a demo scan on intentionally vulnerable configs
./mcp-scan demo

# Scan the provided configs in this folder
./mcp-scan -c vulnerable-config.json -c secure-config.json
```

- The `demos/` folder contains realistic configurations for both best-practices and intentionally unsafe setups.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Demo Configurations

- **secure-config.json:** Strong security practices
- **vulnerable-config.json:** Multiple security flaws
- **mixed-config.json:** Secure and risky patterns
- **development-config.json:** Common pitfalls in dev environments
