## Critical Findings

### ðŸ”´ Critical Risk Issues
**[Server Name] - [Specific Issue]**
- **Risk:** [Specific vulnerability or misconfiguration]
- **Impact:** [What could happen - data breach, system compromise, etc.]
- **Evidence:** [File paths, config snippets, or process details]
- **Remediation:** [Specific action required]
- **Timeline:** [Immediate/24 hours/1 week]

**Example:**
**filesystem-scanner - Root Directory Access**
- **Risk:** Server configured with read/write access to entire filesystem (`"args": ["/"]`)
- **Impact:** AI agent could read sensitive files, modify system configs, or escalate privileges
- **Evidence:** `~/.config/Claude Desktop/claude_desktop_config.json` line 15
- **Remediation:** Restrict access to specific directories only (`"args": ["/home/user/projects"]`)
- **Timeline:** Immediate

### ðŸŸ¡ High Risk Issues
**[Follow same format for high-risk findings]**

- **Network Access:** [X] servers with external connectivity
- **Command Execution:** [X] servers that can run shell commands
- **Database Access:** [X] servers with database connectivity
- **API Access:** [X] servers with third-party API access

### Trust Chain Analysis
- **Official Registry:** [X] servers verified in MCP Registry
- **Known Publishers:** [X] servers from trusted organizations
- **Unknown Sources:** [X] servers from unverified sources
- **Custom/Internal:** [X] internally developed servers
- **Outdated:** [X] servers running outdated versions

## Compliance Gaps

### Policy Violations
- [ ] Servers installed without security approval
- [ ] Missing documentation for business justification
- [ ] Inadequate access controls
- [ ] No change management process
- [ ] Missing monitoring/logging

### Regulatory Considerations
- **SOX Compliance:** [Impact assessment for financial controls]
- **GDPR/Privacy:** [Data access and processing implications]
- **Industry Standards:** [Sector-specific requirements]

---

## Immediate Actions Required

### Within 24 Hours
1. **Disable Critical Risk Servers**
   - Remove or restrict `[specific server names]`
   - Document business impact of disabling

2. **Emergency Access Review**
   - Audit all servers with filesystem root access
   - Implement temporary access restrictions

### Within 1 Week
1. **Implement Discovery Controls**
   - Deploy automated MCP scanning across all developer machines
   - Establish inventory management process

2. **Policy Development**
   - Create MCP server approval workflow
   - Define acceptable use guidelines

### Within 30 Days
1. **Comprehensive Remediation**
   - Address all high-risk findings
   - Implement least-privilege access controls

2. **Monitoring Implementation**
   - Deploy logging for MCP server activities
   - Set up alerting for unauthorized installations

---

## Long-term Recommendations

### Governance Framework
- **Approval Process:** Require security team approval for all new MCP servers
- **Regular Audits:** Quarterly MCP security assessments
- **Training Program:** Developer education on MCP security risks

### Technical Controls
- **Automated Scanning:** Integrate MCP discovery into security tooling
- **Access Controls:** Implement centralized MCP configuration management
- **Monitoring:** Real-time alerting for suspicious MCP activities

### Risk Management
- **Vendor Assessment:** Due diligence process for third-party MCP servers
- **Incident Response:** Procedures for MCP-related security incidents
- **Business Continuity:** Fallback plans for critical MCP dependencies
